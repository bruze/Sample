[Kitura is a lightweight and simple web framework](http://kitura.io) that makes it easy to set up complex web routes for web services and applications. 

ToDo List demonstrates how Kitura 2s new Codable Routing features can help developers leverage Swift 4's Codable protocol and write code that works on both the front and back end. A new client library is used in the app called [KituraKit](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/KituraBuddy), which is open source so feel free to contribute! 

It is built against a set of [ToDoBackend tests](http://www.todobackend.com/) to showcase the power of Kitura 2 and its API.

If you would like to import KituraKit into your own iOS project please see [KituraKit Usage](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/KituraKit/blob/master/README.md).

If you would like to view this sample app with an SQL database connected view the [persistentiOSKituraKit branch](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/iOSSampleKituraKit/tree/persistentiOSKituraKit).

### Quick Start*

1. Install [Xcode 9](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835) or later.

2. Clone this repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/IBM-Swift/iOSSampleKituraKit.git`

3. Navigate into the [ToDoServer folder](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/iOSSampleKituraBuddy/tree/master/ToDoServer) using: 

    `cd /iOSSampleKituraKit/ToDoServer/`

4. Run the following commands to compile the code:

    `swift build`

5. Start the server with: 

    `.build/x86_64-apple-macosx10.10/debug/ToDoServer`

**Note:** This command will start the server and it will listen for new connections forever, so the terminal window will be unable to take new commands while the server is running. For more info on the Server component, [click here](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/iOSSampleKituraBuddy/blob/master/ToDoServer/README.md).

6. Open new Terminal window to continue with the Quick Start. 

7. Navigate into the [KituraiOS folder](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/iOSSampleKituraBuddy/tree/master/KituraiOS) using:

   `cd /iOSSampleKituraKit/KituraiOS`

8. Open the iOSKituraKitSample workspace with:

    `open iOSKituraKitSample.xcworkspace`

A new Xcode window will open. For more info on the iOS app, [click here](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/iOSSampleKituraKit/blob/master/KituraiOS/README.md).

8. Ensure that the Scheme in Xcode is set to the iOS Application. The Scheme selection is located along the top of the Xcode window next to the Run and Stop buttons. If you don't see a Kitura icon (white and blue) in the box next to the Stop button, click the icon that's there and select the App from the drop down menu.

9. Make sure an iPhone X is selected in the drop down menu next to the Scheme, not "Generic iOS Device". The iPhone Simulators all have blue icons next to their names. iPad is not supported at this time.

10. Press the Run button or âŒ˜+R. The project will build and the simulator will launch the application. Navigate your web browser to the address http://localhost:8080 to see an empty array. This is where ToDos made in the app are stored. As you add or delete elements in the app, this array will change.

*The Kitura component can be run on Linux or macOS. Xcode is not required for running the Kitura server component (Xcode is only required for the iOS component).
